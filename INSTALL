Installation procedure for Blitz++


1.  Installation

1.1 From tarfile

Unpack blitz-VERSION.tar.gz in the directory of your choice.  The file 
blitz-VERSION.tar.gz file will unpack into a subdirectory blitz-VERSION.  

Blitz++ now uses a standard CMake build workflow. For a typical system, 
simply running "cmake ." with no options is sufficient.  
CMake will explore your system to discover the available compilers and 
appropriate options to use.  To select a different C++ compiler than the 
one discovered, give the option -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<compiler-name>.  
The standard configure option -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir>
may be used to select the installation directory for Blitz++.  

Once you have generated build files with CMake, do:
        make lib

This is a minimal build of just the Blitz++ library.  You can also do:

        make check-testsuite  Build and check the testsuite
        make check-examples   Build and check the examples
        make check-benchmarks Build and check the benchmarks (long)
        make install          Install Blitz++
        make info             Build Blitz++ texinfo documentation
        make ps               Build Blitz++ ps documentation
        make pdf              Build Blitz++ pdf documentation
        make html             Build Blitz++ html documentation
        make install-info     Install Blitz++ texinfo documentation
        make install-ps       Install Blitz++ ps documentation
        make install-pdf      Install Blitz++ pdf documentation
        make install-html     Install Blitz++ html documentation

3.  Getting started

There are example programs in the "examples" directory.
The original Blitz++ documentation is found in the "manual" directory.
Point your browser at manual/index.html, or do "gv manual/blitz.ps".
However, this form of the documentation is no longer being actively
maintained.  More up-to-date documentation is kept in the "doc" directory.
