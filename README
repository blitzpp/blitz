Blitz++ is a C++ template class library which provides array objects
for scientific computing.  It is not a linear algebra or fft library;
see http://oonumerics.org/oon for libraries that will do those things.

The original Blitz website is at http://oonumerics.org/blitz.  The Blitz
project is now hosted by SourceForge and can be found on the web at 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/blitz.

Licensing information is at http://oonumerics.org/legal.
Summary: you can do anything except sell this library in source
form.  Blitz is licensed under both the GPL (see COPYING)
and a less restrictive (non-viral) "artistic license" (see LICENSE).

2.  Compiling programs

All Blitz++ header files are referred to with a prefix of "blitz/".
For example, to use the Array<T,N> class, one needs to include
<blitz/array.h> instead of just <array.h>.
To make this work, the main Blitz++ directory must be in
your include path.  For example, if Blitz++ was installed
in /software/Blitz++, you will need to compile with
-I/software/Blitz++ and -L/software/Blitz++/lib -lblitz

To summarize, a typical command line is:

g++ foo.cpp -o foo -I/software/Blitz++ -L/software/Blitz++/lib -lblitz

To avoid the -I and -L options, you can set up symbolic links -- see
INSTALL for details.
